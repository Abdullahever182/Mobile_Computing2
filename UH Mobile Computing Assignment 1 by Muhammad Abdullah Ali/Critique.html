        <h2 class="mb-4">Critique</h2>
        <p>I have chosen the following two Apps to critique.</p>
		<br>
        <li><a href="ePub Reader for Android.webp">ePub Reader for Android</a></li>		<br>
        <p>This app  manages.epub files downloaded from websites so you may read them as books or web pages. The software isn't tied to a bookstore or online library. Also, it provides links to obtain DRM-free ePub files. This software formats chapters into book pages quickly and with minimum power. If you're experienced with web browsing, you can read the chapters as raw web pages on this app.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Features</p>
		<p>The programme is a lightweight ePub reader that requires less power and functions normally even on older Android devices.</p>
		<p>- It's a downloader, unbound to any book store or online library instead possessing a built-in browser. This browser can access any address. When you click a.epub link, the software imports it for you. The software lists websites where you can download ePub books.</p>
		<p>- ePub files can be read in either web page or book format, depending on the reader's preference. When reading an ePub book, you have the option of using either taps or swipes to turn the pages.</p>
		<p>- The app remembers where you left off reading and the text size you were using for each book you open, saving you time and effort as you read. A bookmark is a handy way to keep track of where you left off.</p>
        <p>- This programme doesn't drain your battery quickly and it uses very little power.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Comparison with our E-Reader App</p>
		<p>One function which this App possesses which is missing from the E-Reader is an in-built browser. My E-Reader only enables the user to read the ebook files present on an Android device not download them. However our E-Reader supports more file formats e.g. Epub, PDF, COMIC, Mobi e.t.c while this Epub reader only allows users to read books in the Epub format. In addition our E-Reader also has an in-built Ebook converter which users can use to convert their files into a format which is readable by our E-Reader while the Epub Reader for Android App does not offer that.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
        <li><a href="Eboox.webp">eBoox: ePub PDF e-book Reader</a></li>		<br>
        <br>       
	   <p>eBoox is an ebook reader supporting the following formats: fb2, epub, pdf, doc, docx, mobi, prc, txt, rtf, odt, html, cbr, cbz, zip and rar archives. eboox allows for simple book loading from the device's file system, SD card, the cloud, or a web browser. There are no ads on eBoox, and it's completely free to use.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Features</p>
	 <p>- Fast page loading.</p>
	 <p>- Simple and convenient book's loading from your memory card or the Internet.</p>
	 <p>- Friendly interface.</p>
	 <p>- Support service which values user opinion.</p>
	 <p>- Possess several directories in different languages.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Comparison with our E-Reader App</p>
	 <p>This reader supports the same formats that my E-Reader App supports. However one feature it does possess over E-Reader is the user support service which is currently not factored into the plans for the E-Reader App.</p>
